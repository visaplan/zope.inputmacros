Generic METAL macros for input fields

This package uses the TAL_ / METAL_ XML-based template language introduced by
Zope_ to provide simple input fields from Python dictionaries,
without any connection to schema data whatsoever.


Features
--------

- Forms built by `div` or `table` elements
- `readonly` fields
- `required` fields
- labels


Examples
--------

This add-on is currently under development and not yet used on public internet
sites.


Documentation
-------------

After installing, you may try the views

- formfields_div_
- formfields_table_

in your Zope instance; the macros are "self-documenting".

*Note:* Currently it helps to understand German;
those views are not (yet?) internationalized.


Installation
------------

Install visaplan.zope.inputmacros by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        visaplan.zope.inputmacros


and then running ``bin/buildout``


Requirements
------------

You'll need a language interpreter as well; this will be given in default
Zope / Plone installations.
We don't specify this here to allow you to choose your own.

Starting with Plone 5, Chameleon_ with the z3c.pt_ compatiblily layer is used;
this should work as well.
