1.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Bootstrap 2 version

  When developed in the first place (and not yet released as a
  distributable package), the macros had been used with Bootstrap 2.
  Thus, it would be possible to create a Bootstrap-2-based release;
  but it is not very likely this to be done.
